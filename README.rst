Phaser
--------

Phaser is a program to phase read clouds into a latent number of
clusters, such that clustered read clouds all share the same SNP profile.
It is a dependency of the `Gordian Assembler <https://github.com/abishara/gordian_assembler>`_.

This repository and setup material is currently under construction.  It
will soon be updated with easy to use instructions.
