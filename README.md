# Introduction

TBD.

# Install

First, we will need to install the relevant packaged. Make sure that a virtual environment is set up. For instance, to install a python 3 environment:
```bash
virtualenv phase.ve -p python3
```

Next, enter the environment. Following the previous example:
```base
source ./phase.ve/bin/activate
```

Finally, install all the requirements:
```base
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
